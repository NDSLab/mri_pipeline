##Slice Timing
---------------

###General Information

Every recorded volume of the brain consists of a number of slices which are collected at slightly different time points. Slice timing corrects for these differences in time of acquisition. All images are aligned to the time of acquisition of a reference slice, usually the middle slice.

Slice timing correction is not necessary if you have a block design. For more information on slice timing correction: (http://mindhive.mit.edu/node/109) and the SPM manuals.

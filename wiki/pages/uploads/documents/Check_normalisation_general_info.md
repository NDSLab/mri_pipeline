#Check Normalisation and Registration
===============
##General Information

Normalization goes wrong in about 10% of the cases, for example when the comparison gets stuck in a local minimum. It is therefore important to check all normalized structural images. For functional images, it might be a good idea to randomly pick some images to check.

#Checking data quality
========================
## General Information
------------------------

After combining the data, we can run some data quality scripts to see whether our data looks normal. 

Checking the data quality is based on the researcher visually inspecting the data. The data checks deal with intensity (should be stable), and spikes (sudden peaks in intensity in one slice, one volume). If you see many spikes during your experiment, notify Paul.

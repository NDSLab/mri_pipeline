##Segmentation
---------------

###How to do it

The SPM tissue probability maps can be found in (/home/common/matlab/spm8/tpm). 

Before starting segmentation, copy these files to your working directory on the M-drive, and call them from there. 
Bias correction will remove any slow varying intensity.

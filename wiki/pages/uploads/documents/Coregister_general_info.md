##Coregister Estimate

###General Information

During coregistration, the functional and structural data from individual participants are aligned. 
Only rigid body transformations are performed: translations in x, y and z directions, and rotations over x, y and z axes. The reference image stays stationary, while the source image is moved around to match the reference image.

# Documentiation Overview

This wiki describes how to use the preprocessing pipeline of [our group](http://www.decisionneurosciencelab.com) and what it does. In addition, it provides some guidelines on how to proceed to first and second level analyses using SPM12. It can be [viewed online](http://ndslab.github.io/mri_pipeline/doc/) at github.io, and, after downloading the repository, offline by opening `doc/offline.html` in Firefox (Chrome and Safari will not work).

See the [Getting Started](pages/howto_getting_started.md) to get going as soon as possible.

The [Documentation](pages/doc_overview.md) describes in detail what the scripts are doing and explains why the specific steps were chosen.
